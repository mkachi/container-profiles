# ðŸ”’ Container Profiles for Firefox

This is a WebExtension that enhances Firefox's container tab functionality by treating each container as if it were a **separate user profile**.

## âœ¨ Features

- Remembers the selected container and automatically opens all tabs in it
- Changes the extension icon based on the selected container's icon (using Lucide icons)
- Shows the selected container's name as a tooltip
- Replaces existing tabs with new ones in the selected container (`replaceTab`)
- Allows programmatic control of container behavior
